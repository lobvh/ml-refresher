    "We've managed to develop our simple `predict-customer.py` Flask app, and now we want to send the request to it and decode the request to something meaningful which could be sent to a Marketing team that sends the promotional emails. It is not easy from our browser to send the POST request (when you enter manually in your browser `localhost:9696/predict` and press Enter it is doing a GET request), so that is why are we using this to test and 'see' before putting it into final Python script.\n",

    "Flask is a proxy of WSGI server. When you 'run Flask' you are running built-in Werkzeug's development WSGI server, and passing your Flask app's callable. In the context of WSGI, a \"callable\" refers to a Python object (usually a function or a callable class) that the WSGI server can invoke to handle an incoming HTTP request. This callable is the entry point for the WSGI server into your Flask application.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We will put another layer on top of Flask app. We will create a `gunicorn` web server locally. Then we will specify to Gunicorn the module and the variable inside that module that represents the WSGI callable. eg. `gunicorn run predict:app`. Essentialy, we are creating locally a WSGI server (Gunicorn) that can handle much more than our 'development server' in terms of security, speed, multiprocessing etc. "
