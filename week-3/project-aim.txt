Think of having a telco company which aims to understand why people churn in a first place, and then automate that process by using ML models which predicts
if the customer will actually churn. Given that information telco company could offer discounts, promotions etc. or work on fixing some common things that may be hidden due to
complexity of the whole system/process of work.

But, having a ML model informing you about whether customer will actually churn or not might be a tricky problem.
Imagine sending a discount to a customer that is already satisfied with price and everything that the company is offering. Those are false positives.
What comes to my mind to mitigate this problem is using  one of the 'up-to-date' uncertainty quantification methods, 'conformal prediction'.
People and companies who adopt CP see a great benefit in assesing the uncertainty that 'predict_proba' can't actually quantify.
Just for the sake of learning and applying it I will use it in this project.

Be aware that this toy project serves it's purpose as a playground, but on large-scale projects where the real money is involved, usually there are a LOT of things to consider 
than what this project can offer.
